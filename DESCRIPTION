Description: Functions and methods for manipulating SNOMED CT concepts.
    The package contains functions for loading the SNOMED CT release into
    a convenient R environment, selecting SNOMED CT concepts using regular
    expressions, and navigating the SNOMED CT ontology. It provides the
    'SNOMEDconcept' S3 class for a vector of SNOMED CT concepts (stored
    as 64-bit integers) and the 'SNOMEDcodelist' S3 class for a table
    of concepts IDs with descriptions. For more information about SNOMED CT
    visit <https://www.snomed.org/>.
